# Kickstarter-Analysis

Overview of Project:
	In this analysis we are observing and visualizing how different times of the year can affect various Kickstarter campaigns across different genres and mediums.  With a primary focus on theatrical Kickstarter visualizing how launch date affects outcomes on total pledged dollars to the fundraising goal.

Analysis and Challenges:
	During my analysis I used many Pivot Tables ![This is an image](https://github.com/BMoreland20/Kickstarter-Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Parent%20Category%20Outcomes.png) and Graphs ![This is an image](https://github.com/BMoreland20/Kickstarter-Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png) to visualize trends in funding outcomes depending on parent categories, subcategories, and launch date.  I also examined how funding goals could affect funding outcomes for plays in particular using '=COUNTIFS('Raw Data'!$F:$F, "successful", 'Raw Data'!$D:$D, "<1000", 'Raw Data'!$R:$R, "plays")' formula and by using descriptive statistics for to examine the characteristics of the funding goals to the pledged amounts for example to calculate SD I used '=STDEV.P('Successful US Kickstarters'!D:D)' and to calculate upper and lower quartiles I used '=QUARTILE.EXC('Successful US Kickstarters'!D:D, 1)' and '=QUARTILE.EXC('Successful US Kickstarters'!D:D, 3)'. During this challenge I faced challenges when copying code for my COUNTIFS formulas.  When copying the code to other cells to save time the Cell ranges would auto update to the next adjacent cell breaking my code.  I learned how to overcome this by using $ to make the cell values as absolutes I went from '=COUNTIFS('Raw Data'!F:F, "successful", 'Raw Data'!D:D, "<1000", 'Raw Data'!R:R, "plays")' to '=COUNTIFS('Raw Data'!$F:$F, "successful", 'Raw Data'!$D:$D, "<1000", 'Raw Data'!$R:$R, "plays")'.  Having done this I was able to copy and paste my code and make minor changes to my code to accommodate the Goal column see image ![This is an image](https://github.com/BMoreland20/Kickstarter-Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Outcomes%20Based%20on%20Goal.png).  After this was sorted I faced minimal challenges afterwards.

Results/Conclusions:
	1) The first conclusion that can be made is that the best time to have a theatrical Kickstarter is in the last two months of Q2 (May and June) ![This is an image](https://github.com/BMoreland20/Kickstarter-Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Success%20Percentages%20Theater%20Outcomes%20by%20Launch.png).  These Kickstarters had the highest success rate at 67% and 65%, we could hypothesize that the reason for this is that this is early summer, and people could be more available and willing to watch theater performances.  A second conclusion is that the winter months are a bad time to have a Kickstarter campaign as these had the trend to have the lowest success rate with December at the lowest percentage at 49% ![This is an image](https://github.com/BMoreland20/Kickstarter-Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Success%20Percentages%20Theater%20Outcomes%20by%20Launch.png).  We could hypothesize that due to the weather people are less willing to traverse and that due to the holidays their money is tied up elsewhere and have fewer funds to spare.
	2) For plays Kickstarter campaigns that are less than $1000 have the best chance of success with a success rate of 76%, the second best are plays that fall between $1000 and $4999 with a success rate of 73% ![This is an image](https://github.com/BMoreland20/Kickstarter-Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Outcomes%20Based%20on%20Goal.png).  The plays with a goal of $45,000 and above have the lowest chance of success with $45,000 and $49,999 with a zero percent chance of success and 50K and up having at 13% chance of success ![This is an image](https://github.com/BMoreland20/Kickstarter-Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Outcomes%20Based%20on%20Goal.png).
	3) A limitation that we face is we don't have a full set of demographics.  Because of this missing data we can't explore who donates the most to what type of media.  As we could determine who more likely to donate for theatrical Kickstarter i.e., could it be women who are more likely?  Because of this we can't extrapolate an outcome.  The other limitation due to a lack of demographics is we don't know what living environment best fits a given category of media.  For example, people who live in an urban environment could be more willing to fund a Kickstarter for theatrical or artistic Kickstarter.  Whereas a suburban dweller could be more interested in funding a technology-based Kickstarter.  With this kind of data you could better target potential add placement to increase the likelihood of success.
	4) From the Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date sheet we should build a table that show the percentage of success and failure based on those months.  I built a portion of this table when discussing part one of the discussion/results section. Another table/graph we could bill could be based on the blurb section and success rate.  It could be interesting to see how each blurb was written if that could have had an influence on the result of the given medium that the Kickstarter was funding.  By using descriptive statistics, we could determine if there is a correlation between the two.
